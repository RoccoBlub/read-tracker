## Project Scope

### Objective
To create a user-friendly web application that allows users to track their light novels and manga reading.

### Key features
1. Reading Progress Tracking
   - Users can increment or decrement chapter count with a simple plus/minus button instead of manually entering numbers.
   - A quick overview of currently reading, completed, and dropped titles.
   - Option to add notes or comments on specific titles.
2. Title Search & Auto-Completion
   - A dedicated searchable title database to handle large collections (1,000+ titles).
   - As users type in a title, the system will suggest existing titles from an external manga/novel database.
   - If the title is found, it can be added to their list instantly.
   - If the title is missing, users can manually add it.
   - Optimized indexing for fast searching and retrieval.
3. Import & Export Functionality
   - Users can import their existing lists (CSV, JSON) to avoid manually inputting 1,000+ titles.
   - Bulk upload support to quickly transfer data from spreadsheets.
   - Ability to export reading history for backup or migration.
4. Cover Image Management
   - Users can upload their own cover images for a title.
   - Future enhancement: The system will automatically fetch cover images using web crawling.
5. Personalized Library & List Management
   - Users can categorize their collection (e.g., Reading, Completed, Dropped, Wishlist).
   - Ability to filter by genre, author, or user-defined tags.
   - Search function to quickly find previously read titles.
6. Popular Titles & Trends
   - Slideshow on the homepage showcasing most-read novels and manga based on user activity.
   - Ranking system that tracks:
     - Most-read titles (total chapters read across all users).
     - Trending now (titles frequently updated by users in the last 30 days).
     - Leaderboard of the most active readers.
7. Authentication & User Profiles
   - OAuth integration (Google login) for a seamless sign-in experience.
   - Users can customize their profiles with avatars, reading stats, and favorite genres.
8. Backend Enhancements
   - Redis caching for faster API responses.
   - BullMQ for background tasks, such as fetching cover images asynchronously.

## Future Enhancements
- Web Scraping Integration: Automate fetching of manga/novel metadata and images.
- Social Features: Friends list, shared recommendations, and reading challenges.
- Mobile App Extension: Progressive Web App (PWA) support for an enhanced mobile experience.
- Export/Import Data: Allow users to migrate from spreadsheets or other tracking systems.
